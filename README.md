raml2html-test-spec
===================

Just a simple RAML 1.0 API used to test the type annotations additions I'm working on for raml2html.

To use:

- Clone [my fork of raml2html's default theme](https://github.com/matatk/default-theme) and, in its directory, run `npm link`.
- Clone this repo and, in its directory, run `npm install` and  `npm link raml2html-default-theme`.

You can then use `npm run spec-html` to generate the HTML for this repo and check out the work on type annotations.
